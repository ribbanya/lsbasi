- What is a compiler?
  - A translator that processes and executes source code **with** converting it to machine language.
- What’s the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?
  - An interpreter translates source code into tokens and executes the code; a compiler does the same but converts the source code into machine language first.
- What is a token?
  - An object encapsulating a series of characters representing a semantic element that the parser can understand.
- What is the name of the process that breaks input apart into tokens?
  - *Lexical analysis*, or *lexing.*

  - The *lexical analyser.*
- What are the other common names for that part of an interpreter or a compiler?
